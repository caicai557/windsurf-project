# Teleflow 2025: Imperial Manifest

## 1. Vision
To construct a digital entity capable of "Durable Execution", "Hybrid Perception", and "Physical Stealth". It is not a tool; it is a sovereign automated species utilizing the Telegram protocol.

## 2. Ultra Think Principles
* **Reverse Thinking**: Question every convention. Why use locks? Why use JSON?
* **Da Vinci Planning**: Blueprint before bricklaying.
* **Subtraction**: Elegance is found in what can be removed, not added.

## 3. Technology Stack (The Arsenal)
* **Core**: Rust (Tokio, Ractor, Sqlx, Chromiumoxide)
* **Interface**: Tauri v2 + Vue 3 (Composition API)
* **Persistence**: SQLite (WAL Mode, JSONB State Storage)
* **Protocol**: MessagePack (Binary Console Bridge)
